Here are the data structures with brief descriptions\+:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_c_l_controller}{CLController}} \\*An implementation of a PIDF (F = Feedforward constant) closed loop controller. It is a generic controller that takes in a measurement, controller constants, and a setpoint and outputs an effort to be sent to the actuator }{\pageref{struct_c_l_controller}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_display}{Display}} \\*The class that implements the control of the TLC59116 16-\/Channel FM+ I2\+C-\/\+Bus Constant-\/\+Current LED Sink Driver to display the current note on the tuner }{\pageref{struct_display}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_encoder}{Encoder}} \\*A generic implementation of a quadrature encoder that tracks the position of the encoder in counts and the speed the encoder is traveling at in counts per second }{\pageref{struct_encoder}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_motor}{Motor}} \\*An implementation of a motor driver using a struct to emulate Object Oriented Programming. The motor has 4 parameters, timer which indicates the timer to be used to run the motor, channels, which indicates the channels to be used to run the motor, duty\+\_\+cycle, the duty cycle to run the motor at, and enable\+\_\+flag, which determines if the motor is allowed to run }{\pageref{struct_motor}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_pitch_encoder}{Pitch\+Encoder}} \\*This class, in an object oriented sense, inherits the \doxylink{struct_encoder}{Encoder} class but specifically reads values from the pitch encoder to map them to a specific pitch }{\pageref{struct_pitch_encoder}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{\mbox{\hyperlink{struct_r_c___controller}{RC\+\_\+\+Controller}} \\*An implementation of an RC controller that sends pulse widths from its two control axes--a trigger and a wheel--through infrared. The motor has parameters for the timer used for the input capture of the pulse widths, the pulse widths sent by the controller for each of the axes, the values of time of the rising edges and falling axes for each axis, and flags that indicate a falling edge has been detected and therefore a period should be caulculated }{\pageref{struct_r_c___controller}}{}
